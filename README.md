# There are 3 questions that need to overcome in order to develop Artificial General Intelligenes:
1. Create a curiosity system that always asks everything including from the answer that is given by the response system and or from the implementation that builds from the response system.
2. Create a response system which always tries to give the best response or answer for each question from a curiosity system.
3. Create an implementation system which is always try to implement or to manifest all of the best answer that giving from the response system

The questions are actually a dialectic thinking process, which is a method of exploring ideas through dialogue and examination of opposing viewpoints. By engaging in a dialectic approach, we can systematically analyze and refine concepts, generate new insights, and improve the quality of our responses and implementations. Dialectic thinking encourages critical thinking, problem-solving, and continuous improvement.
Here's a high-level approach to consider those questions:
1. Creating a Curiosity System:
   - Implement a feedback loop within the curiosity system that captures the answers or responses provided by the response system or implementation system.
   - Use the feedback loop to generate follow-up questions based on the received answers, aiming to explore deeper or related aspects.
   - Design algorithms or techniques that promote exploration by diversifying the types of questions asked, such as by considering different perspectives or seeking contrasting information.

2. Developing a Response System:
   - Train the response system using large datasets of question-answer pairs to improve its ability to generate accurate and relevant responses.
   - Utilize advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including semantic analysis, contextual understanding, and sentiment analysis, to enhance the quality of responses.
   - Incorporate machine learning models, such as deep learning architectures or transformer models, to generate more sophisticated and context-aware responses.
   - Implement an evaluation mechanism that ranks or scores the responses based on factors like accuracy, relevance, coherence, and user feedback.

3. Implementing the Best Answers:
   - Develop an implementation system that analyzes the responses generated by the response system and translates them into actionable steps or solutions.
   - Utilize domain-specific knowledge or expertise to convert the abstract answers into concrete plans or executable instructions.
   - Implement mechanisms to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solutions or actions.
   - Continuously iterate and improve the implementation system based on user feedback and real-world outcomes to ensure the manifested answers are practical and useful.
